=== Staggered Finned-Tube Heat Exchanger - Full Domain (MPI Parallel) ===

Date: 2025-12-09
Solver: chtMultiRegionSimpleFoam (MPI parallel, 4 processors)

--- Domain Configuration ---
N REV repetitions: 10
Domain size: 1.2 m x 0.06 m x 0.05 m
Total solid regions: 30 (individual tubes)

--- Mesh Statistics ---
Fluid cells: 595,566
Solid cells: ~6,500 (per tube region)
Total nodes: 145,727

--- Boundary Conditions ---
Inlet velocity: 1.0 m/s (fixedValue)
Inlet temperature: 300 K
Solid temperature: 350 K (initial)
Outlet: zeroGradient

--- MPI Parallelization ---
Method: simple (4x1x1 decomposition)
Processors: 4
Decomposition: Along streamwise (x) direction

--- Results (Time = 200) ---
Outlet temperature: ~308 K
Temperature rise: ~8 K through heat exchanger
Mass flow conservation: Verified (inlet ≈ outlet)

--- Notes ---
- Simulation demonstrated successful MPI parallelization
- Flow development visible through N=10 REV units
- Heat transfer from solid (350K) to fluid (300K inlet)
- Numerical instability occurred at T=226 (needs relaxation tuning)
