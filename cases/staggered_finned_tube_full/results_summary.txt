=== Staggered Finned-Tube Heat Exchanger - Full Domain with Extensions ===

Date: 2025-12-09
Solver: chtMultiRegionSimpleFoam (MPI parallel, 4 processors)

--- Domain Configuration ---
N REV repetitions: 10
Inlet extension: 1 × S_L = 60 mm (for uniform inflow)
Outlet extension: 5 × S_L = 300 mm (for wake recovery)
Core length: 10 × 2×S_L = 1200 mm
Total domain: 1560 mm × 60 mm × 50 mm

--- Mesh Statistics ---
Fluid cells: 639,867
Solid regions: 30 (individual tubes)
Total nodes: 155,335

--- Boundary Conditions ---
Inlet velocity: 1.0 m/s (fixedValue)
Inlet temperature: 300 K (fixedValue)
Outlet: zeroGradient (velocity), fixedValue 0 (pressure)
Solid temperature: 350 K (initial)

--- MPI Parallelization ---
Method: simple (4×1×1 decomposition along x)
Processors: 4
Total runtime: ~16 minutes (1000 iterations)

--- Results (Time = 1000) ---
Inlet temperature: 300 K
Outlet temperature: 315.5 K
Temperature rise: +15.5 K through heat exchanger
Mass flow conservation: Verified (inlet ≈ outlet)

--- Improvements over Previous Version ---
1. Added inlet extension (1×S_L): Uniform inflow before first tube row
2. Added outlet extension (5×S_L): Wake recovery region prevents backflow
3. Numerical stability: Completed 1000 iterations without divergence
   (previous version diverged at T=226)
